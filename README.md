# login_with_amazon

Provides the [Login With Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/sdk-download) as a Flutter Plugin.

## Work In Progress

The Plugin is work in progress, PRs are very welcome.

At the moment, only a basic set of functionality (login, get users' email, signOut) is implemented.

Future versions should bring all of the native data (user profile etc.) to the Dart side.
